# EarthId Client Side Integration

## Setup developer API credentials
  1. Contact us on future@myearth.id
  2. Register yourself as vendor with [MyEarthId](https://www.myearth.id)
  3. We will generate apiKey and secretKey of the respective app.
  4. These credentials are important for initializing our sdk. The example for the same is given below.

## Integration Steps

### Step 1: Include earthId.js file within your code

### Step 2: Generate QR code
function to creates a QR code image link for login with earthId or for document.

```
const qrCodeLink = await generateQrCode();
```

#### Parameters

-   `type` **[string]** this is optional, supported values are **login** (to get profile information) or **document** if documents are also required from earthId app.
- `socketId` **[string]** this is optional, only required if you want to listen data using socket.

#### Response
Returns **[string]** response web URL string of QR code generated which needs to display as image

### Step 3: Display generated QR code link as image within your application
```
<img id="qrCode" src={qrCodeLink} style={{ width: 150, height: 150 }} />
```

### Step 4: Open EarthId Mobile App to scan the QR code

### Step 5: You will see authorization popup in EarthId App to authorize or deny the request to share your profile data

### Step 6: You will get user data on registered webhook, as belows:

We expect 200 as a API response after you receive receive a callback otherwise earthID will retry for 2 more times. also you can check for duplicate post requests by reqNo.

#### User approved authorization
```
{
    "permission": "granted",
    "fname": "Rahul Asati",
    "userEmail": "rahul@rejolut.com",
    "userMobileNo": "+918512806087",
    "dob": "",
    "emailVerified": true,
    "score": 450,
    "earthId": "42707778",
    "mobileVerified": true,
    "duration": "86400000",
    "requestType": "login", //or "document"
    "documents": ["",""] //if requestType is document and user has authorized to share
}
```
#### User denied authorization
```
{
    "permission": "denied"
    "earthId": "42707778",
    "requestType": "login", //or "document"
}
```

#### verifyGatewaySignature 

Before we process any data from the webhook weâ€™ll want to validate that the request really came from EarthID and not someone pretending to be EarthID. EarthID signs each webhook request with the your application secretKey. The signature is contained in the x-request-signature-sha256 header and is a SHA256 HMAC hash of the request body with the key being your application secretKey.

You can validate the webhook by generating the same SHA256 HMAC hash and comparing it to the signature sent with the payload.

```
export async function verifyGatewaySignature(req) {
    try {
        const hmacReceived = req.headers["x-request-signature-sha-256"];
        const reqBody = req.body;
        if (hmacReceived && reqBody) {
            var hmacCreated = crypto.createHmac('sha256', 'QWERTFCXSWERTGV').update(JSON.stringify()).digest('hex');
            if (hmacReceived === hmacCreated) {
                return true;
            } else {
                return false;
            }
        } else {
            return false;
        }
    } catch (e) {
        return Error(e);
    }
}
```

#### Parameters
-   `req` **[object]** req object of postback URL received

#### Response
Returns **[boolean]** signature is valid or not.


### Step 7 (optional): Connect to EarthId socket URL and Listen for user data

```
import io from 'socket.io-client';

const socketUrl = "https://socket.myearthid.ml";

let socket = await io.connect(socketUrl);
socket.on('connect', () => {
    //lisetn for user data
    socket.on(`userdata`, async data => {
      if(data.newreq && data.newreq.permission == 'granted') {
        let userData = data.newreq;
      } else { //denied
        //show alert or similar to notify user has denied the request.
      }
      disconnectSocket();     
    });
    resolve(socket.id)
})
```

#### User approved authorization
```
{
    "permission": "granted",
    "fname": "Rahul Asati",
    "userEmail": "rahul@rejolut.com",
    "userMobileNo": "+918512806087",
    "dob": "",
    "emailVerified": true,
    "score": 450,
    "earthId": "42707778",
    "mobileVerified": true,
    "duration": "86400000",
    "requestType": "login", //or "document"
    "documents": ["",""] //if requestType is document and user has authorized to share
}
```
#### User denied authorization
```
{
    "permission": "denied"
    "earthId": "42707778",
    "requestType": "login", //or "document"
}
```
